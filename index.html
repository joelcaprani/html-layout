  <h1>The Imbalance of Culture Fit
  </h1>
  <p>
    Part of getting to a better place in the new year is
    recognizing where we have sway, and going past our own
    discomfort to create positive change in ourselves and
    in the world. Those of us who have a role in the hiring
    process can do better by thinking critically about
    culture fit. Matt Griffin challenges us to consider
    whether it actually creates the kind of team that’s
    the best for the enterprise, or mostly serves to make
    us comfortable by surrounding us with people largely
    like ourselves in ways that aren’t relevant to the
    business.
